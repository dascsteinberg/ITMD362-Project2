# ITMD362-Project2
Self-critique:
I delved more into the Java Script side of Web Dev this semester. I was able to make
most of the JS for the project work, and fix errors other people had with their JS. 
My main JS contributions were, making login username/password validate and make 
the actual credentials of the person who signed in show up at the top of the page. 
I would have liked to have been able to implement some PHP and a SQL server, but
that was beyond my grasp.


Team Evaluations:
Sara Majewski - Sara was really good with setting up the visual look of the project.
She made the color schemes and basic look of the project when she created the login page.
She also created the footer that we used throughout the project. She was also a wiz with 
CSS and fixed any issues anyone couldn't figure out. She was a real asset to the team.

Tim Kang - Tim created the add/drop page for the group. He also was able to fix some
problems we had with the navbar and form issues. He would often remind of of tasks
and keep us on track. I enjoyed working with him.
 
Jacob Knific - Jacob was the other main contributor to the JS on the site. He also created
the Registration pin page. He helped us solve some media queries issues we had. He was nice
to work with.
 
Ian Hernandez - Ian created the home page, navbar and some media queries. This set the tone for the rest
of the pages in the project. He also helped me with some HTML issues I had with page, that made it look
different from the rest of the site. He was a pleasure to work with.
